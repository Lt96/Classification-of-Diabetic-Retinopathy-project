# Feature Extraction of Diabetic Retinopathy Using Fundus Images 
Diabetic Retinopathy is a very common eye disease in people having diabetes. This disease can lead to blindness if not taken care of in early stages. This project is a part of the whole process of identifying Diabetic Retinopathy in its early stages. In this project, we will extract basic features which can help us in identifying Diabetic Retinopathy in its early stages. There are many clinical features of Diabetic Retinopathy but in this project, we focused on retinal blood vessels and exudates.


## **Prerequisites**

1. [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads)
